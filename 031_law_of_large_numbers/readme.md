### Law of Large Numbers
-----

#### Motivation
This experiment wants to explore a little bit the **Law of Large Numbers** (or LLN) with a dice rolling example.
At same time, looking back by the rearview mirror, this was one of first scripts I did as a student of Data Scientist. The theme of Law of Large Numbers concatenates a statistical knowledge with a programming exercice.

#### Introduction
In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), the  **Law of Large numbers**  (**LLN**) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. Importantly, the law applies (as the name indicates) only when a *large number* of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be "balanced" by the others (see the  [gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy)).
