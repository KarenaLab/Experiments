Law of Large Numbers
---

This experiment wants to explore a little bit the **Law of Large Numbers** (or LLN) with a dice rolling example.

In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), the  **Law of Large numbers**  (**LLN**) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value") and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. Importantly, the law applies (as the name indicates) only when a *large number* of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be "balanced" by the others (see the  [gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy "Gambler's fallacy")).

#### How to run/perform codes
All codes are in python and has the following parses:

`LargeNumbers.py` has the following parsers:
* -r = Saves the **r**eports, creating  and adding all plots inside a folder called *Report*;
* -q = Disable the verbose mode, stays **q**uiet;

`LargeNumbers_stddev.py` has the following parsers:
* -r = Saves the **r**eports, creating  and adding all plots inside a folder called *Report*;
* -q = Disable the verbose mode, stays **q**uiet;
