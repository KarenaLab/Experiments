#### Experiments

Experiments sometimes has a good results, sometimes not so good results; but all experiments at the end increases your level.
This is the reason of this area, it is simple.

Some rules for this area:
* A **summary** of the problem or issue that the experiment wish to explore. This summary could have a **description** or **motivation**,
* A **short guide**, sometimes is not possible, but a plan for the next trip is always welcome,
* A **delivery**, to set up what partners will exchange or what the following part need is alwaus important. Most of all experiments are self-contained and a designed delivery is not mandatory,
* And **results**, this is my favorite part, where and experiment of 15 seconds turns into chapters and chapters of developement, creates another possibilities and experiments.

More rules:
01. Follow the standard of folder name [ project number ] _ project name.
02. Follow [PEP-008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as close as possible,
03. Follow [Numpy docstring](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) as close as possible. *Readability counts*,
04. Tools are always changing, so create an [enviroment card](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and all taylor made tools, store in folder *src*.
05. Smaller ´.csv´ are welcome but avoid big ones.
06. Store all your results in folder *report* and, it is very important to explicit it,
07. Talking about explicit. *Explicit is better than implicit, simple is better than complex*,
08. Give credits, you do not live alone in this world and,
09. *Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules*.
