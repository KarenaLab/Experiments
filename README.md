## Experiments

Experiments sometimes has good results, sometimes not; but at the end increases your level.
This is the reason of this area, it is simple.

Some rules for this area:
* A **summary** of the problem or issue that the experiment wish to explore. This summary could have a **description** or **motivation**,
* A **short guide**, sometimes is not possible, but a plan for the next trip is always welcome,
* A **delivery**, to set up what partners will exchange or what the following part need is always important. Most of all experiments are self-contained and a designed delivery is not mandatory,
* And **results** (this is my favorite part). *In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess*. It is where an experiment of 15 seconds turns into chapters and chapters, pages and pages of development, creates another possibilities and experiments and, at the end, give me a great joy of increasing my knowledge and, if possible, help another ones,
* If exists, The `p[number]_analysis.ipynb` must reflects the `readme.md`. 

More rules:
* Follow the standard for folder name: `[project number]_project_name`.
* Follow [PEP-008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [Numpy docstring](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) as close as possible. *Readability counts*,
* Tools are always changing, so create an [enviroment card](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and all taylor made tools store in folder `src` to create repeatibility along the time,
* Smaller `.csv` datasets are welcome but avoid big ones,
* Store all your results in folder `report` and it is very important to explicit it. (Sometimes a Powerpoint is better than a notebook).
* Talking about explicit. *Explicit is better than implicit, simple is better than complex*,
* Give credits, you do not live alone in this world and,
* *Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules* and,
* Experiments are never fisnished, there is always a way to make it better, different or explore some hidden place. It is an excellent idea to do it again.
